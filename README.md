# Soko Storefront Assignment CodeBase

## About Project

This project is an attempt of the assignment provided by Soko Technologies for a frontend internship position
[see the assignment](https://github.com/soko-tech/engineering_assignments/blob/main/README.md)

## Technologies used

As a requirement, I used React.js to implement the site. In the React.js ecosystem, I used the following

    * Material UI
    * Redux
    * React Hot Toast
    * React Router
    * Lorem Ipsum

## Project Structure

The project is generally structured as follows

    * src folder => contains the react code that is loaded in the div id root in index.html
    * App.js => project entry file
    * pages folder => contains all distinct pages of the app
    * datastore folder => contains the file that simulates a backend data source
    * images folder => contains all images used in project
    * components => contains all components in the app
    * redux => contains redux store defination and redux actions exportation

## More Info

I used redux for app level state management and to simulate data fetching. In the redux devtools extension in the browser, it's possible  
to visualize the data fetching actions as I thought would take place in the actual implementation of the storefront.

## Progress

Due to closing in of the deadline, I was unable to complete the account module, which contains the screens for checkout and phone  
authentication.
